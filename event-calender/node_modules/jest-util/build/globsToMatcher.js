/**
 * Converts a list of globs into a function that matches a path against the
 * globs.
 *
 * Every time picomatch is called, it will parse the glob strings and turn
 * them into regexp instances. Instead of calling picomatch repeatedly with
 * the same globs, we can use this function which will build the picomatch
 * matchers ahead of time and then have an optimized path for determining
 * whether an individual path matches.
 *
 * This function is intended to match the behavior of `micromatch()`.
 *
 * @example
 * const isMatch = globsToMatcher(['*.js', '!*.test.js']);
 * isMatch('pizza.js'); // true
 * isMatch('pizza.test.js'); // false
